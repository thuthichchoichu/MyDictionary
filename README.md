Overview
This is a dictionary application for Android devices. 
2 years ago, I used all of my knowledge about Android to build a dictionary app for studying new vocabularies.
It has serveral features like translation, online and offline dictionary, allowing me to get a first job for professional Android Developer.
And now, I'm going to make a new version of the app, using the latest framework like JetpackCompose and Coroutine, as well as new UI design.
